# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm Implementation in C# (.NET Framework)

This repository hosts a robust and fully-functional implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, written in C# using the .NET Framework. 

## Project Overview

This project is designed as a **module** and is not intended for standalone use. It is best utilized when integrated into other projects as a **dependency**. Detailed instructions on how to incorporate this module into your project can be found in the usage section.

The project encompasses the following key features:

* **Data Ingestion**: Efficient reading and handling of data from files.
* **Algorithm Implementation**: Implementation of both dummy algorithms and the KNN algorithm.
* **Data Normalization**: Ensures the uniformity of data by applying normalization techniques.
* **Distance Calculation**: Computes distances using both the Euclidean distance formula and cosine similarity.
* **Data Validation**: Rigorous validation of data to ensure accuracy and reliability.

This project serves as a comprehensive solution for those seeking to leverage the KNN algorithm in their .NET applications.
